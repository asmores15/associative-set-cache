# associative-set-cache
This was a final project for the lab portion of my Computer Architecture class. 

It is a 2-Way Set Associative Cache that allows the block and set sizes to be changed by the user. The amounts of bits for the tag and set index would be adjusted accordingly. The block and set size would be loaded into the memory and the instruction cache would then be resized. After this, the instructions would be loaded from the memory into the cache. This cache takes the place of the instruction memory in a single-cycle 32-bit MIPS design.
